###Spending An Hour With [Odyssey.js](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/)

###### Gave the Odyssey.js sandbox a spin last night, and within an hour was able to make a pretty cool story/map out of a Washington Post story. The article discusses 5 of Virginia's best beaches you've never heard, and to no surprise, they are all within the Hampton Roads region, where I live.  

######Having very little dev experience was not an issue, and the sandbox editor with markdown made it really easy to customize many elements.

######Good Job @CartoDB !!!
